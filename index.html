				<h3>We, the people, have been oppressed by the British Empire for far too long. Starting with the 1767 “Townshend Revenue Act”, and most recently with the 1773 “Tea Act”, we have spent nearly a decade suffering under ridiculous taxation without representation. No more shall the people of Boston accept this abuse. For that, we provide a solution:</h3>

				<p class="first-paragraph">To tackle the unjust taxation upon the citizens of Boston, we plan to host the “Boston Tea Party”. This will be an evening where we make our voice heard. We care not for their tea, but for our freedom.
					</p>
				<p>The Boston Tea Party will be held alongside the Harbor, between the times of 8:00pm and 10:00pm on Thursday, December 16, 1773.
					</p>
				<p>Participants may purchase a ticket for admission, and all funds will be used towards costumes and preparations. Participants are expected to keep this event a secret and commit to the cause of protesting the unfair British taxation.
					</p>
				<p>The two days leading up to this night, we will prepare all necessary props and plans to retaliate against Britain’s reigning terror.
					</p>
					<p>For the first of these days, local seamstresses and tailors shall provide guidance on period attire and help design disguises. Participants are encouraged to look the part of Mohawk Indians or other nondescript characters to avoid identification. Those who are sneaking onto the targeted ships will undergo training for a smoother and more efficient infiltration.
