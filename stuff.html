					<h2>We, the people, have been oppressed by the British Empire for far too long. Starting with the 1767 “Townshend Revenue Act”, and most recently with the 1773 “Tea Act”, we have spent nearly a decade suffering under ridiculous taxation without representation. No more shall the people of Boston accept this abuse. For that, we provide a solution:
					</h2>
					<p class="first-paragraph">To tackle the unjust taxation upon the citizens of Boston, we plan to host the “Boston Tea Party”. This will be an evening where we make our voice heard. We care not for their tea, but for our freedom.
						</p>
					<p>The Boston Tea Party will be held alongside the Harbor, between the times of 8:00pm and 10:00pm on Thursday, December 16, 1773.
						</p>
					<p>Participants may purchase a ticket for admission, and all funds will be used towards costumes and preparations. Participants are expected to keep this event a secret and commit to the cause of protesting the unfair British taxation.
						</p>
					<p>The two days leading up to this night, we will prepare all necessary props and plans to retaliate against Britain’s reigning terror.
						</p>
						<p>For the first of these days, local seamstresses and tailors shall provide guidance on period attire and help design disguises. Participants are encouraged to look the part of Mohawk Indians or other nondescript characters to avoid identification. Those who are sneaking onto the targeted ships will undergo training for a smoother and more efficient infiltration.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="letter">
					<p>For the second of these days, before the “Party”, leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock of the Sons of Liberty shall make a guest appearance at the Old South Meeting House, where they will provide a briefing on the importance of the upcoming event and its potential consequences, as well as remind us of our forgotten Independence.

						On the evening of our final day, those disguised as Tomahawk Indians shall board the ships of Dartmouth, Eleanor, and Beaver
						
						Participants dump the taxed tea into Boston Harbor as a symbolic act of protest against British taxation. Afterward, participants quickly disperse and return to their normal lives, maintaining their secrecy. 
						
						For more information on our guest speakers, members of the Sons of Liberty, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, see Page Two.
						
						This will be a pivotal moment in our history. You do not want to miss history as it is being written.

						<h2>The Patriot’s Pledge
						</h2>
						<p>
							In the face of oppression, we, the Sons and Daughters of Liberty, stand united for the cause of freedom. As we gather on this eve, on the cusp of history, let our hearts beat in unison with the drum of independence.
							
							We pledge allegiance to the spirit of liberty, to the soil that birthed us, and to the rights bestowed upon us by nature and Providence. We declare our steadfast resolve to resist the chains of tyranny, to cast off the yoke of unjust taxation, and to safeguard the birthright of every freeborn American.
							
							With conviction in our hearts and the fire of freedom burning in our souls, we stand poised to make history. As we embark on this act of defiance, this symbolic protest, we remember the sacrifices of those who came before us. We invoke the spirits of patriots who laid the foundations of this great land.
							
							Let this act be a beacon of courage for generations to come. May the echoes of our dissent reverberate through the annals of history, inspiring future patriots to rise against tyranny.
							
							In solidarity, we pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. As we dump this tea into the harbor, let it signify not just an act of protest, but a symbol of our unwavering commitment to the principles of liberty.
							
							For, in the face of adversity, we are Patriots. In the pursuit of freedom, we are United. And in the pages of history, we shall be remembered as those who stood undaunted, casting off the chains of oppression for the cause of a free and independent America.
							
							God save the land of the free!
						</p>
						<h2>In Remembrance: Honoring the Patriots of the Boston Massacre</h2>
						<p>
							As we gather in the shadow of history, let us pause to remember the sacrifice of our fellow patriots who fell on the streets of Boston on that fateful night of March 5, 1770. The echoes of the Boston Massacre still resonate in our hearts, a solemn reminder of the heavy toll our pursuit of freedom demands.
							
							Five brave souls paid the ultimate price in the struggle against tyranny. Their names etched not only in the cold stone of history but in the very fabric of our nation's quest for liberty. On this solemn occasion, we stand as heirs to their legacy, guardians of the flame they lit with their lives.
							
							As we mourn the loss of our brothers, let us also draw strength from their sacrifice. Let their memory be a rallying cry, a call to action that reverberates through the chambers of time. The blood spilled on that cold Boston night was not shed in vain; it waters the roots of our resistance, nurturing the seeds of liberty.
							
							In their honor, we gather on the eve of a new chapter in our struggle. The Boston Tea Party awaits us as an opportunity to channel our grief into purpose, our sorrow into resolve. Let the tea we cast into the harbor be a libation, an offering to the spirits of those who paved the way with their courage.
							
							As we stand on the precipice of history, let us be fueled by the memory of the fallen. May their sacrifice ignite the flames of liberty in our hearts, pushing us to challenge the oppression that led to that tragic night. In their memory, let us forge ahead, united and resolute, with the unwavering belief that freedom, once won, is a beacon that can never be extinguished.
							
							May the Patriots of the Boston Massacre rest in eternal peace, knowing that their sacrifice was not in vain but sowed the seeds of a nation that would stand as a bastion of liberty.
